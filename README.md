# R training materials

Inital objective: FDA R Training Course

We use data related to COVID-19 infections and Census data (2010, as of 04/30/2021). The primary objective is to demonstrate visualization tools associated with R. The core packages we use and cover are:

  > tidyverse (dplyr, lubridate, stringr, ggplot2, haven)
  > shiny
  > rjson
  > data.table
  > sf
  > viridis (beautiful coloration)

We also rely on some collateral packages related to the R environment setup:

  > devtools (for downloading development versions of other packages)
  > compiler (for profiling, timing)
  > rstudioapi (for setting working directories)

Finally, we (may) use a couple move packages as specific visualization tools

  > gifski
  > animate
